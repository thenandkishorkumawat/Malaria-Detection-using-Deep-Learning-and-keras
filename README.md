# Maleria-Detection-using-Deep-Learning-and-keras

Deep learning model for malaria classification. Utilises a convolutional neural network (ResNet) architecture.
Uses Keras with a Tensorflow backend. 
ResNet model class code from Deep Learning for Computer Vision with Python (2017) 
Overall training accuracy is 98%.

This project uses Keras to detect Malaria from Images. The model used is a ResNet50 which is trained from scratch.
The images in this [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/thenandkishorkumawat/cellimagesfordetectingmalaria) is divided into to categories
- Parasitized
- Uninfected
